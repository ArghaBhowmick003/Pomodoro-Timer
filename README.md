It's a strict timer.........if you cheat on time or thinking of stopping time then the POMODORO technique strikes there.
You can stop the 25 min timer but can not resume it again.
You will have to start from the begining and it's a traditional POMODORO timer for real.
Excuses will not be tolerated.
Stay Focused........Happy Coding ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿
